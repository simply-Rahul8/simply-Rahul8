Hi, I’m Yaswanth Rahul Yarlagadda.

I’m a Full-Stack and AI Engineer, and I enjoy building systems end to end,starting from clean, thoughtful user interfaces, all the way down to scalable backend services and intelligent, AI-driven decision layers. My work lives at the intersection of software engineering, cloud platforms, Machine learnig and applied AI, and what motivates me most is solving problems where technology genuinely helps people understand complex things or work more effectively.

I didn’t arrive at AI by chasing trends. I came here through engineering.

I started by building full-stack applications working with React, Angular, .NET, and Python, and deploying systems on AWS, Azure, and GCP. Over time, I realized I was most interested not just in using tools, but in understanding how systems behave under real constraints scale, latency, security, and maintainability. That curiosity naturally led me into AI engineering.

What draws me to AI roles is the chance to go deeper than “calling a model.” I care about how models reason, how prompts shape behavior, and how context is managed. I actively experiment with prompt engineering, Retrieval-Augmented Generation, and multi-LLM orchestration, focusing on reliability, explainability, and reducing hallucinations in production systems. For me, AI is not magic—it’s a system that needs to be designed carefully.

That mindset shows up clearly in my projects.

For my bachelor’s thesis, I built a 3D pose estimation system for fatigue detection using low-cost, smartphone-based motion data. Instead of relying on expensive lab equipment, I designed a practical pipeline using Python, TensorFlow, and OpenMMLab that achieved 93% accuracy. That project shaped how I think about applied machine learning—research that solves real problems and can actually be used.

Alongside research, I’ve built production-ready AI systems. I developed a customer feedback analysis platform that combines rule-based logic with AI to deliver low-latency, fault-tolerant insights. I’ve built privacy-first RAG chatbots that let users query personal documents locally, keeping data ownership and security front and center. I’ve designed multi-LLM systems where prompts, retrieval, and orchestration matter more than raw model size.

I’ve also worked deeply in core engineering. I’ve led teams building mobile apps with React Native and Firebase, shipped full-stack SaaS platforms serving hundreds of users, designed microservices with Docker and Kubernetes, and built serverless systems on AWS. Whether it’s backend-heavy architecture or user-facing products, I take full ownership—from design to deployment.

How I work is just as important to me as what I build.

I’m structured, curious, and calm under pressure. I like breaking complex problems into smaller, testable ideas, iterating quickly, and still keeping the bigger system in mind. I enjoy collaborating with teams, mentoring junior developers, and explaining complex technical ideas clearly—especially to non-technical stakeholders.

What ultimately drives me is this:
I want to design intelligent systems that people can trust. I want to work on products where AI decisions matter, where backend reliability matters, and where good engineering directly shapes user experience.

If you explore my work, you won’t just see finished code. You’ll see experiments, trade-offs, and learning in progress. That’s how I grow as an engineer and that’s how I aim to create real impact.

🧠 What I Build (Selected Work)

My projects reflect a balance between engineering depth and applied intelligence:

1. 3D Pose Estimation for Fatigue Detection (Bachelor’s Thesis)

A research-focused machine learning system designed to detect physical fatigue using low-cost, smartphone-based motion data. Built with Python, TensorFlow/Keras, and OpenMMLab, the system achieved 93% accuracy and demonstrates applications in healthcare, sustainability, ergonomics, and robotics-adjacent motion analysis. This project reflects my strong interest in applied ML, human motion understanding, and real-world impact.

2. Customer Feedback Analysis Tool

A hybrid rule-based + AI-assisted system built to analyze customer feedback with low latency, fault tolerance, and scalability in mind. The platform processes user messages, performs sentiment analysis, extracts key topics, triggers alerts, and presents insights through a lightweight UI. This project highlights my ability to design practical AI systems that integrate smoothly into production workflows.

3. CNN vs Capsule Networks – Comparative Research Project

A research-driven study comparing Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Capsule Networks (CapsNets) for image and pattern recognition tasks. The project evaluated accuracy, robustness, and feature representation, showcasing CapsNet strengths in preserving spatial hierarchies and motivating future applications in computer vision, intelligent systems, and robotics.

4. Dual-LLM Insight Engine

An AI chatbot system combining multiple large language models with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) for secure and scalable knowledge retrieval. The project focuses on prompt engineering, multi-LLM orchestration, and cloud-ready architecture, demonstrating how intelligent systems can be made reliable and automation-friendly.

5. Personal Data RAG Chatbot (Streamlit + Ollama)

A privacy-preserving AI chatbot that enables natural language querying over personal documents using LangChain, FAISS, and locally hosted LLMs. Designed with a strong emphasis on data ownership, cybersecurity awareness, and responsible AI, this project showcases practical RAG implementation beyond cloud-dependent setups.

6. Intelligent Consent Flow for Medical Care

A Generative AI–powered conversational system that transforms complex medical information into clear, patient-friendly explanations. Built using Streamlit, speech-to-text, and LLMs, the system improves accessibility, trust, and usability in healthcare workflows, highlighting my interest in human-centered AI design.

7. GamePlan Mobile App

Led the development of a React Native mobile application backed by Firebase, focused on task management and GPS-based attendance tracking. Built using Agile practices and test-driven development, this project reflects my experience in team leadership, mobile development, and end-to-end delivery.

8. TaskFlow – Smart Task Management System

A full-stack SaaS application serving 200+ users, built with ASP.NET Core, Angular, SQL Server, JWT authentication, and real-time features. The project demonstrates strong backend fundamentals, secure authentication, scalable architecture, and clean frontend integration.

9. Microservices-Based Online Food Ordering System

A backend-intensive system designed using microservices architecture, implemented with .NET, REST/gRPC communication, Docker, and Kubernetes. This project showcases my understanding of scalable backend engineering, service isolation, and cloud-native design.

10. COVID-19 Data Analysis Dashboard

A data-driven web dashboard developed using Python, Flask, Pandas, and Matplotlib to visualize real-world COVID-19 data. The project focuses on data preprocessing, visualization, and research-oriented decision support.

11. Grayscale Image Processor (AWS Serverless)

A serverless cloud application built with AWS Lambda, S3, and CloudWatch to automate image processing workflows. This project highlights my hands-on experience with event-driven architectures and cloud-native services.

Across all projects, I focus on clean architecture, scalability, and long-term maintainability, not just getting something to “work.”



If you’re exploring my repositories, you’ll find not just code—but experiments, trade-offs, and learning in motion. That’s how I grow as an engineer, and that’s how I aim to create impact.
